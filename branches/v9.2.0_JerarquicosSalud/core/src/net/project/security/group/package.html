Provides for creating and modifying security groups.
 
A <code>Group</code> is a mechanism by which <code>Person</code>s may
be aggregated and security permissions defined for them.<br>
A group has zero or more members.  Those members are groups themselves.  A
group is owned by a single space.  However, a group may be available in other
spaces, effectively allowing its members to have privileges within that other
space.<br>
A special kind of group, called a <code>Principal Group</code> has Persons
as its members.  A Principal Group has a single owning Person and a Person may
own at most one Principal Group in a space.  A Principal group may have 
additional members.  A Principal Group's name is effectively that of its owner.
This allows security to be defined on groups alone and to relate a single
Person to a Group within a space.  It also allows additional Persons to share
the permissions of the owner, by including them in the Owner's Principal Group.<br>
Principal Groups, along with Space Administrator and Team Member groups are
<code>System Group</code>s.  A System Group's name may not be modified.  Additionally,
System Groups may not be removed from a space.<br>
<code>UserDefined</code> Groups are groups created by a user in the application.
