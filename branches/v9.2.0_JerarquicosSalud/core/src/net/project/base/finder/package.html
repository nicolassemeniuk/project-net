This package provides a set of classes that allow you to construct SQL statements
programmatically.  This primary component for doing this is a component known as
a finder component.  Finder components provide a location to collect all of your
SQL statements.  With careful programming, you can keep most SQL related information
in one place and reduce maintainance.<br>
<br>
This package also provides filtering and sorting plugins which create where
clauses and order by clauses, respectively.  These objects are generally only
used when you have a structured query page that you want to generate.  If you
are just creating a query statement for a new object, write a new findBy statement
in your finder object instead.<br>
