<h3>
<a name="mime_types"></a>Documents</h3>
<b>Q: How does Project.net know which application to use when I select the
View Document tool?</b>
<p><b>A</b>: Project.net uses mime types to associate your document with
an application.&nbsp; This mime-type is sent to your web browser when you
select the View Document tool.&nbsp; Your browser has a table that associates
a given mime-type to an application to use for that mime-type.
<p><b>Q: What is a mime type:</b>
<p>A: MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.&nbsp; Mime
types are a standard for specifying the format of files transferred over
the internet. These Mime-types are associated to file extensions on the
server as well as the client and that type is communicated to the browser
when needed.&nbsp; The browser is then aware of which application is to
be used to view the particular file.&nbsp; For example, a file with an
extension of ".dgn" is configured on the Project.net server as a mime-type
"application/ustation"; when a Project.net user requests such a file (View
Document tool) the server sends the mime type along with the file when
it downloads to the client machine.&nbsp; The browser then looks for that
mime-type within its configurations to determine the application on the
client to use for viewing the document.&nbsp; So within the example, the
client workstation would associate the mime type application/ustation with
the application ustation.exe.
<p><b>Q: How do I configure my browser’s mime-types to use the correct
application?</b>
<p><b>A</b>:
<h3>
<a name="netscape_mime_type_set"></a><i>In the Netscape browser</i></h3>

<ol>
<li>
Goto Edit Preferences under the Category, select Navigator Applications.<img SRC="<%=SessionManager.getJSPRootURL()%>/images/help/edit_preferences.gif" height=459 width=545></li>

<li>
Highlight the Application and select Edit.&nbsp;<img SRC="<%=SessionManager.getJSPRootURL()%>/images/help/edit_type.gif" height=383 width=341 align=TEXTTOP></li>

<li>
Select the Browse button under the Handled by: Application field and select
the desired executable from your local machine.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a name="IE_mime_type_set"></a><i>In Microsoft Internet Explorer</i></h3>

<ol>
<li>
Open Microsoft Explorer.</li>

<li>
Select View Options/Folder Options and select the File Types Tab.<img SRC="<%=SessionManager.getJSPRootURL()%>/images/help/view_options_file.gif" height=439 width=367></li>

<li>
Highlight the application in question and select Edit.&nbsp;<img SRC="<%=SessionManager.getJSPRootURL()%>/images/help/edit_mime.gif" height=409 width=347 align=TEXTTOP></li>

<li>
Highlight the open Action and select Edit.&nbsp;<img SRC="<%=SessionManager.getJSPRootURL()%>/images/help/edit_open_action.gif" height=164 width=347 align=TEXTTOP></li>

<li>
Use the Browse button to select the Application to be used to view the
document.</li>
</ol>
NOTE:&nbsp; When downloading a file of a mime-type that is not recognized
by the client, your machine will use the extension association to locate
an application to use for viewing. If none is found you should be prompted
to pick an application to use for viewing.
<p><a name="hotlink_main"></a><b>Q: When I select the hypertext link for
a document it usually gives me an option to view it or download it.&nbsp;
But for certain file types is automatically opens the file for viewing
without giving me the option to download it.</b>
<p><b>A</b>: This is because an option has been turned off for those particular
file types. When you download a file from the internet, you are usually
prompted to Download or View the document. In the dialog that pops up giving
you that choice, there is a checkbox which allows you set the preference
for your browser to not offer you that choice again. If you uncheck the
"Always Ask" preference then your browser will never give you the choice
again, it will always download it or always view it depending on your current
choice. If you would like the choice back, then you must change you browser’s
configuration. To do this follow the steps below:
<h3>
<a name="netscape_hotlink"></a><i>Netscape</i></h3>

<ol>
<li>
Goto Edit Preferences under the Category select Navigator Applications.</li>

<li>
Highlight the Application and select Edit.</li>
