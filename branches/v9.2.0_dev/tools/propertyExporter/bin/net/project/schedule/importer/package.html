This package contains the beginnings of a MS Project Import facility.  At this
point, the interface is not well designed and is very likely to change heavily
in the future.  For this reason, it is recommended that no classes or
functionality in this part of the code is extended in any way.  If this warning
is not heeded, be aware that you are likely to encounter an entirely different
interface in the next version of the software.<br>
