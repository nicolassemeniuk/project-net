The form item time series is a report designed to show the how many of each value
an individual form field has taken over time.  If you were to run the report and
to specify a field and table, you might get the following output:<br>
<br>
<center>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td><b>Date</b></td>
<td><b>Field Value</b></td>
<td><b>Count</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>01/01/2002</td>
<td>Apple</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>01/01/2002</td>
<td>Orange</td>
<td>17</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>01/02/2002</td>
<td>Apple</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>01/02/2002</td>
<td>Orange</td>
<td>18</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>01/03/2002</td>
<td>Apple</td>
<td>21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>01/03/2002</td>
<td>Orange</td>
<td>19</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
This table tells us that on 1/1/2002 there were 15 rows which contained the
value "Apple" and 17 that contained the value "Orange" in the field you selected.
On 01/02/2002, there were 20 apples and 18 oranges.  Finally, on 01/03/2002
there were 21 apples and 19 oranges.<br>
<br>
The form item time series report also contains a graph which gives a visual
representation of the same data.  This information could be useful for analyzing
trends, though no formal trendline exists in the data right now.<br>
<br>
This graph is technically difficult to produce, and should be modified with a
lot of thought in mind.  Specifically, it is difficult to avoid queries that run
very slowly.  It is for this reason, that the FormItemTimeSeriesFinder does
4 queries as opposed to one.  Originally this report was constructed with a
single query, but it was rather slow.  This is less a product of bad programming
or missing indices and more a product of a large and complex set of data.<br>
