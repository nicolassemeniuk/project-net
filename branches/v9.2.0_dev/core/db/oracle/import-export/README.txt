have to install 7-Zip Command Line Version (you can find it on http://www.7-zip.org/download.html).

Use
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both Windows and Linux scripts provide a user friendly interface to make the import/export.
You will only have to set the paths required by command line (no need to set anything on the
script itself). Both the clean_and_create_users.sql and compile_views.sql	
script files are provided on the download.
