Your Personal Space allows you to:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Personalize Your Project Space - Track your progress and communicate with
others. Alter the look and feel of your space to suit the way you work
while still adhering to the guidelines established by the project.</li>

<li>
View Document History -- Go back in time to see when and how decisions
were made.</li>

<li>
Track Activity - Check on the progress of others. At-a-glance status allows
you to spot and react to potential schedule creep, before critical path
time lines are affected.</li>

<li>
Propagate Information - Data is instantly distributed to all affected members
on a project.</li>

<li>
Manage Your Project List - Minimize redundancy and reduce the infomation
flow where necessary with custom-defined task and human resource lists.</li>

<li>
Control Access - Restricted information is just that. Keep the detailed,
proprietary cost information accessible only to the specified level of
management users.</li>

<li>
Stay On Top of Things - Quickly see what documents changed since you last
viewed the site. Any change flagged as New could be a change in status,
an additional posting to a Discussion Group, a revised drawing, or a new
group member.</li>

<li>
Notify Others - Tools send E-mail based on user-defined triggers. Users
can elect (or be elected) to receive notification based on event occurrences.
Triggers include milestones, calendar dates, new drawings, updated drawings,
status changes, added documents, deleted documents, online meetings, Webex
meetings, projects or sub-projects that have reached completion, missed
deadlines and members removed (job change, transfer, leave). As not all
events require an immediate response, you can also tailor the notice to
match the importance of the event.</li>

<li>
Maintain Your Schedule - A suite of tools establish and publish project
timelines, due dates, and parallel and concurrent tasks. Estimate project
completion time by summing the serial tasks, establish serial tasks, and
establish task sequence.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main page is where your would typically go after you log on. This
is not a requirement though. As with any browser-based tool, you can go
immediately to where you want on the Project.net site. All you have to do is
pass through the login page.
<p>What you see on the Personal Page:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Communication – From here, you send email, receive notification of Tasks,
Meetings, Schedule dates, Invitations.</li>

<li>
Calendar – Four items appear in a Calendar; Events, Meetings, Tasks, and
Milestones.</li>

<li>
Tasks – A task is anything assigned to you as a member of a project. Once
you have accepted an invitation to a project, the task(s) will automatically
be added to the Personal Space. Too, the tasks will appear in the Project
and Business Spaces. You enter Status information in the appropriate form
in the Project Space to indicate what progress you have made or if there
are any problems.</li>

<li>
Documents – This space lists all the documents you have created, have signed
out, are Tasked to, or their status. What appears in this list is controlled
by the settings defined in Preferences.</li>

<li>
Preferences – Controls the display of information on your screen by listing
more (or less) information displayed with each listed item. You can also
“roll-up” an area to display more items in another grouping.</li>

<li>
Channel Manager – Controls the overall display of information on your screen.
You can elect not to display some of the sections on your computer screen.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>Calendar Event – is a process that takes place within a given time
frame for an activity. For example, if the activity is to pour a foundation,
this action will have a start date (when the first concrete truck arrives)
and an end date (when all the concrete has been poured). Events are created
when you start a task.
<br>Calendar Meeting – is a type of event. When you create a meeting you
also create a list of attendees and an agenda.
<br>Calendar Task – is an event with a zero time frame. Scheduling a meeting
is a task.
<br>Calendar Milestone – is a task with a single date. Finish pouring concrete
is a milestone.
