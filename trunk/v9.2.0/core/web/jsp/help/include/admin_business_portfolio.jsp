Typically, the main Business is a collection of channels which indicate,
at a corporate level, all the current project activities and their status.
As such, you can match the site to the way you work, using business to
business cooperation for the entire project lifecycle. By managing the
deliverables and providing a central point for the diverse and complementary
teams across the project life cycle, you can ensure coordination of all
aspects of a project. <br>
