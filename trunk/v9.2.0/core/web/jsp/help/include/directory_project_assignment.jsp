<p>
Assignments is where your individual Tasks and their status are viewed.
This is also the space where you accept or decline the assignment. Each
task is listed by Assignment, Space Name, Type, Status (whether or not
the Type is accepted), Percentage Complete, and Assignment role. Each of
these columns can be sorted.
<p>The two Filters, Status and Space, allow you more easily categorize
your tasks, when the list may take more than a page.
