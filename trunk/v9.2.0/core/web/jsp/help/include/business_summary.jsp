Typically, the main Business is a collection of channels which indicate,
at a corporate level, all the current project activities and their status.
As such, you can match the site to the way you work, using business to
business collaboration for the entire project lifecycle. By managing the
deliverables and providing collaboration for the diverse and complementary
teams across the project life cycle, you can ensure coordination of all
aspects of a project. For example, you can start a project with architects
in the initial planning stages, add contractors for site preparation, concrete,
structural, plumbing, HVAC, and electrical, establish a design approval
mechanism, and schedule meetings. With the tools in the Project.net site, the
meetings may be virtual with WebEx, take place in a conference room, or
take place on-line in a discussion group.
<p>The Business Space allows you to see both who is in your organization
and what they are working on. In addition to considering the people and
the projects separately, the Project.net Business Space will allow you to combine
the two. For example, you can view not only a list of all projects in your
firm, but also who in your firm is working on what project. And with the
project information you can also see time lines and status reports, allowing
you to project more realistic deadlines, and allocate resources appropriately.
<p>Business Space is not a static “read-only” tool. You can create projects
and then staff them from your firm’s complete roster. As you can sort the
employees by their skill-sets and departments, teams can quickly be created,
with just the right employees. And because you also have access to the
current project lists, you can avoid possible “double-booking” and assign
staff based on availability.
<p>Other controls within the Business Space will allow you to control who
has access to what information, especially on shared projects. While department
managers may need complete status information, co-workers could be restricted
viewing just those documents you determine are required. This access control
helps protect sensitive information by limiting who is allowed to view
or change information on the site. For example, on one project you may
collaborate with a rival firm. In this case, you only want them to see
your organization’s status on those phases where there are joint activities.
You do not want a rival firm to be able to view proprietary financial and
staffing details. With the built-in <a href="Help.jsp?page=security_project">site
security</a>, you can control precisely what any use can see.
<p>In summary, the business space gives you control over your staff, their
projects, project timelines, and access to information. By combining this
information on a single site, operational efficiency is greatly increased,
resulting in a bigger bottom line.
<p>The Channels are:
<ul>
<li>
Business Summary – A complete list of the documents modified in the last
seven days. The display of this data is user configurable, post V1.</li>

<li>
Teammates on line – Lists all project members on the roster who are on-line
(or have been on line in the last 2 hours). This check will be user-configurable
post V1 to indicate who is on line.</li>

<li>
Metrics – These are the indicators of project progress and include Milestones,
Deliverables, and more. The Metrics are set-up to make the site inviting
and gives users a sense of community via telepresence.</li>
</ul>
