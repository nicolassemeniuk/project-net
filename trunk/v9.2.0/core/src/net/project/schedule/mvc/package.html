The MVC package is an implementation of a model-view-controller architecture
that attempts to start moving the application from what is known as a JSP
"Model 1" architecture to something a bit more modern.

The code desires to break up all user round trips into three parts:
<ol>
<li><b>Controller:</b> This code that actually does the work of loading, saving,
and routing.  This part does everything that is normally considered to be
"domain logic."</li>
<li><b>Model:</b> This code stores the information that will be necessary to
render a view.</li>
<li><b>View:</b> This code changes the model into something that users can use,
ultimately HTML or PDF.  The View itself might be coded in JSP, XSLT, or
something like iText that can render PDF.</li>
</ol>
