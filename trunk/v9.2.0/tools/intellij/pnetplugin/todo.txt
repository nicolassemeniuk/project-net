* Change the "property" textbox to a dropdown text box that will remember the
last few (20?) properties that you entered.  This will make it easier when you
are inserting several related properties.
* Work a lot more on the contextual property type code.  Right now, it does a
fairly lousy job in JSP code.
* Figure out how to package the JDBC drivers into the distribution so they don't
have to be separately copied.  Looking at the beanshell distribution, it appears
that an "exploded" format containing both files in a lib directory would
probably work just fine.
* Create a toolbar for properties that allows us to look up property values
without having to open another tool.
* Create some way to modify properties.
* Fix the cancel button on the Property Dialog.  (It doesn't currently close the
dialog box.)
