Provides classes for creating vCalendar, vEvent and vToDo objects.
Version 1.0 is supported.

<p>
<q>The vCalendar is intended to be used for exchanging information about event 
and todo types of calendaring and scheduling entities. An event is a calendaring 
and scheduling entity that represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar. 
For example, it may be an activity; such as a one-hour, department meeting from 
8 AM to 9 AM, tomorrow. A todo is a calendaring and scheduling entity that 
represents an action-item or assignment. For example, it may be an item of work 
assigned to an individual; such as "turn in travel expense today".</q>
